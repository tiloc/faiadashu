> * only works on desktops or landscape tablets, due to screen size requirements
> * requires Flutter 2.8 due to bugs in earlier versions of Flutter
> * keyboard input to FHIR Path field broken on Mac, due to bugs in macOS Flutter: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/94633

* ### Faiadashu Example / Gallery
* Added demos of all the new capabilities listed for Faiadashu.
* Renamed package to `com.legentix.faiagallery`, in order for it to be globally unique (required for some Apple signing stuff)

  * Made async in preparation for query expressions

* ### Faiadashu Online
* **[Breaking]** Upgrade to latest fhir_auth. Login/Logout functionality is currently lost.


## 0.6.0-dev.1
* **[Breaking]** Fix hierarchy of models according to https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179255-questionnaire/topic/Questionnaire.20Response.20example
  * This introduces a strict separation of a questionnaire's structure and a response to this questionnaire
    * QuestionnaireModel contains all static, structural descriptions of the questionnaire
    * QuestionnaireResponseModel contains the result of filling a questionnaire and all dynamic behavior
  * This replaces the previous, simplistic 1:1 relationships between items and responses with proper nested 1:n model
    * Answers can have **nested responses** now. This is a major improvement that could only be enabled through the cleaned up data model.
      * Nested items are created as needed during the initial population of the model - See Bluebook Vitamin K for example.
      * Nested items are created as needed during human interaction (question with nested items is being answered for 
      the first time) - See LOINC AHRQ for example.
      * Nested items are enabled/disabled based on their parent answer
      * >Some dynamic behaviors (initialValue, calculatedExpression...) are not activated for subsequently added nested questions yet
  * Clarified the relationship between FHIR and Presentation Model. The FHIR `QuestionnaireResponse` is used during
model creation to populate the presentation model, and it is created by the aggregator from the presentation model.
But it is not used in between anymore. This is resolving a lot of inconsistencies and complexities.

* QuestionnaireModel is no longer inheriting from QuestionnaireItemModel. This weird relationship had to end.
    
> You should not experience any breakage if you are merely using the questionnaire filler components.
> You will see numerous API changes which will require fixes if you have forked/modified.

> The documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.

* **Repeating question items:** Answers to repeating question items can be added and removed now.
This is a major improvement that could only be enabled through the cleaned up data model.


* More possibilities for theming
* Better narrative generator
* JSON tree copies individual items to clipboard by tapping on them

* Updated dependencies
* Introduced stricter code analysis and fixed some findings

## 0.5.4-dev.6

## 0.5.4-dev.5
* [Breaking] Updated dependencies (Dart 2.14, Flutter 2.5, the latest FHIR and FHIRPath)

than mixing it in with the `fhirResourceProvider`.
* Support keyboard extension: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33675
* Use different keyboard types, based on item type and other item properties

> The following WIP items should not break anything if you are not using these features. They are experimental alphas if 
> you decide to use them. 
> 
> FHIRPath implementation provided by [Grey Faulkenberry's](https://github.com/Dokotela) through the `fhir_path` package. 
>  
> **Feedback welcome!**

    * Show validation error text
  * Turn form read-only when it is complete

  * Tied [github.com](https://www.github.com/tiloc) to [POEditor](https://www.poeditor.com) to enable online contributions

> **CAUTION:** The English and German translations should be decent quality.
> The other translations are rough, incomplete machine translations to illustrate
> that support of multiple languages, incl. RTL languages, is possible.
  
> **Contributions of translations are welcome!** You can either directly provide an ARB file or ask me
> for contributor access to a web-based translation environment through POEditor.
